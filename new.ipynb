In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.

I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences..

Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.     Vertigo\n",

Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.    Diarrhea\n",

He has been taking this pain medication for one month. We are trying to conceive our second baby. Will this medication afect the fetus? Or the health of the baby? Or can it bring birth defects? Thank you.  Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,  fertility\n",

You have two different problems. The lump under the nipple should be removed, biopsied. This will help you to get rid of the disease, and you get a diagnosis. Second problem looks a bit serious one: Pain that prevents you from eating-immediate fullness, and extreme pain. I would advise such a patient to undergo the upper GI endoscopy asap. This can be an ulcer with a problem at the pylorus. The exact diagnosis is the most important to start the right therapy. Do not waste time in starting the therapy.      Ulcer\n",

       "      <td>Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.  However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue.</td>\n",

Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!</td>\n",

Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps.

Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.                                 Diarrhea\n",

Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,                               fertility\n",

You have two different problems. The lump under the nipple should be removed, biopsied. This will help you to get rid of the disease, and you get a diagnosis. Second problem looks a bit serious one: Pain that prevents you from eating-immediate fullness, and extreme pain. I would advise such a patient to undergo the upper GI endoscopy asap. This can be an ulcer with a problem at the pylorus. The exact diagnosis is the most important to start the right therapy. Do not waste time in starting the therapy.

Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I would suggest that you see your doctor. Your baby maybe having bronchiolitis which is a lung infection common to your kids age. It is commonly caused by a virus. Albuterol via nebulization should be utilized in order to alleviate the wheezing and also help with the congestion. A decongestant can also be used for the colds. Also, it would also advise doing a chest X-ray in order to rule out other diseases (ex. pneumonia)sincerely, Mark RosarioGeneral pediatrics/Pediatric Pulmonology                               fertility\n",

Hi, From history it seems that you might be having degenerative changes in your lower back spines giving pinched nerve pressure. There might be having osteomalacia or osteoporosis as well. Go for x-ray lumbosacral region for osteoarthritis. Physiotherapy like back extension exercises will be much helpful. Take B1, B6, B!2 shots or medicine. Take calcium, vitamin A and D supplements. Ok and take care.             Postmenopausal Osteoporosis\n",

I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.                            Lung Disease\n",

Hello. It could be a blood collection due to minor injury or a vein rupture which is also common at this age. It is not an emergency, but you should apply compression bandage and warm compresses if six hours have past. Furthermore, it should get relieved over the next few days but if it continues to increase or persist then you should see a Doctor who can examine the patient. Take care.

Hi, If the symptoms persist that long this suggests the presence of an allergic element. To treat that kind of allergy you can give him an over the counter antihistamines once daily before going to bed. A cough suppressant as dextromethorphan and an expectorant as Murine will help reduce the cough. Make sure he Chat Doctor.  If the green phlegm persists he might require an antibiotic.

I dont know whats going on and this has been going on for months.

Cellophane You for contacting Chat Doctor. Allergic reaction takes some time to settle. In the meanwhile you can cover it over the body by wearing appropriate long clothes which can cover most of the body to hide it. If itching occurs then you can take cetirizine once daily to prevent itching. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health.                       Allergic Reaction\n",

You have not mentioned in your query details regarding cancer you are suffering from. The pain in back radiating down to thigh can be mostly due to metastasis in the spines or in to lymph nodes, You need to consult your treating oncologist and get evaluated by doing C. T scan of abdomen and pelvis and Bone scan. Further treatment will depend upon result of these tests and final diagnosis. Chat Doctor.                                   Cancer\n",

Her breast showed some kind of infection that apparently turned out to have black blisters. I could she those spreading. When we went for lungs x-ray doctor said she has accumulation of water in her lungs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your aunts situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of bacterial infection especially staphylococcus is more in her case. She is having pleural effusion and infective skin lesions on breast. Staphylococcus can cause pleural effusion and blister formation on skin. So chances of staphylococcal infection is more in her case. Better to send pleural fluid culture and sensitivity for the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection.

The chances of conceiving still exist with irregular periods. I don't know if you have been trying to conceive but to no avail. If that is the case, then I think both of you have to be assessed. Infertility within a couple can be linked to a man, woman or both. If everything is fine with you except irregular periods, then I would advise that both of you should see a doctor for assessment and counseling. I hope that helps wish you well  Infertility (Difficulty in Conceiving)\n",

I stepped on what I thought was lawn. Instead I was a bit on the lawn, but the outside of my foot snapped down into a trough. My foot has been swollen since Friday. Today is Thursday. Kept ice on it for 24 hours. Bruising started after that, Now bruising is spreading. It is really dark on my toes. Pain is on outside of my foot, not on my ankle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Hello, You have sustained twisting injury to foot which may lead to sprain or minor fracture in foot bones. Diagnosis needs to be confirmed by doing x-ray of the involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to rule out bony abnormalities. If x-ray is normal RICE therapy is needed which means Rest Ice application Compression bandage and Limb Elevation. Tab Diclofenac sodium twice a day for pain relief and tab Choral forte twice a day for swelling reduction is required. If x-ray shows fracture Below knee slab may be given. If X-ray is abnormal please consult orthopedic surgeon nearby your area.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.                                Fracture\n",

I appreciate your concern towards H pylori infection which normally causes break in the lining of the stomach (peptic ulcer). H pylori is an exceptional bacterium which can survive in the acidic environment of the stomach producing tissue damage result in ulcer. Since this is a bacterial infection, hence antibiotics are used for 2 weeks to kill H pylori. Along with antibiotics Omeprazole is given for a period of 4-6 weeks to suppress the acid production and to increase the healing process of the ulcer. It is not a serious condition, usually triple treatment is sufficient to cure this condition. You must avoid taking Alcohol, hot and spicy foods, NSAID painkiller, smoking, caffeine, carbonated sweetened soft Chat Doctor. I hope all your doubts have been clarified in a simple language,Feedback in this regard is highly appreciated. Take care                                   Ulcer\n",

I have read your report, and I understand your concerns. First I would say to not worry. Normal Alt levels are 7 to 56 unit (depending on from the kits that laboratories use)In one of your tests, your Alt was 60. This level is almost normal and it doesn't always mean a serious condition of your liver. Here are some reasons why a healthy person might have changes in the levels of liver enzymes:-alcohol-exercise -some medications like aspirin, paracetamol,antibiotics, Cholesterol lowering Chat Doctor.

Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Understood the history well. You have an obvious reason for pain - the adhesions and scar must have reformed. But the history of Dyspareunia, meaning painful sex indicated the is some active inflammatory process still going on in the pelvis called PID-Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Cystitis and Procto-colitis are the additional problems causing the pain in abdomen and rectum before and during bowel movements as also during urination. Ovarian cyst can cause problem only if it enlarges fast or gets twisted. I would advise you the following::-Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen.-Enteroclysis-Colonoscopy-exploratory Laparoscopy or Laparotomy which will be of diagnostic and therapeutic value. A proper course of an antibiotic, metronidazole, probiotic may help a bit or more.                                    cyst\n",

I am having some major bilateral temple pain along with numbness that comes and goes in my left arm/hand/fingers. I have had headaches since the aneurysm, but this is different. Also, my moods have been horrible for the past few weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Aneurysm in brain causes headache due to compression of pain sensitive structure in brain. But pain is usually unilateral not bilateral. This pain will not radiate in both upper limb. Bilateral upper limb pain may be due to cervical spondylosis or other causes. You have anxiety of aneurysm, so due to anxiety your mood is horrible because aneurysm does not cause horrible mood change. So your headache may be chronic tension type headache.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning in chest. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.         Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n",

Hi. Thanks for your query, read and understood your problems. You are getting bouts of pain in the upper abdomen within the last 2 years particularly after the gall bladder surgery. This is great news that cardiac problems are ruled out by the tests every time in the emergency Room. This means that we have to find a local cause in the abdomen itself. I would suggest the following:Get Ct scan and MRCP for the hepato-biliary- pancreatic system. Also go for upper GI Endoscopy to rule out Gastric ulcer. Cancer. Colonoscopy for the possible problem of the colon in this area. If required a diagnostic Laparoscopy may help to see or rule out the intestinal adhesion due to bands or kinking or so and can be tackled at the same time. This way a final diagnosis and treatment plan can be done to get you permanent results.           surgery related complications\n",

Opinion and examination with Surgeon is of utmost importance since hole around butt crack could be :1. Pilonidal dimple not transformed into sinus [beginning stage where pain/discharge is not there], so the best management which can be done at home is: keep the area clean and hygienic2. Do not use a cotton bud to scratch, clean or put into hole.3. It could be pressure sore due to prolonged sitting, or old infected boil which opened and left a big hole, thus Opinion/Examination is needed PS. Take care, not at home, but after surgical evaluation and exploration.                           Infected Boil\n",

However, in case you have conceived this month, it is not advisable to take Primal N, as it causes virilization of female fetus and other abnormalities in the baby. There are other formulations of progesterone like Me Chat Doctor. These can be substituted for Primal - N. Please brief your IVF practitioner about the state of affairs and switch over to a safer                                fertility\n",

I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary. One toilet was clogged for nearly two months which I now know could have bred bacterial spores that cause tetanus infections. I cut myself shaving around 1 1/2 months ago. I was out of razors and used a razor that had been sitting in the bathroom with the clogged up toilet I mentioned above. I did clean the razor with rubbing alcohol before use however I had an open wound on my face for a while.. About a week. For about a month now I have been feeling extremely irritable, experiencing lockjaw symptoms, been short of breath, had fevers on and off, heart palpitations, and I have noticed that when I smile my face contorts into what one would call a sardonic smile. Am I going to die? Please let me know your opinion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Tetanus is a bacterial disease by clostridium retain. There is no cure for tetanus, but it can be prevented by adequate vaccination. Usual symptoms are all due to painful contraction of muscles as it affects our nervous system. Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles, stiffness of your neck muscles, difficulty swallowing, stiffness of your abdominal muscles, painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically frittered by minor occurrences, such as a Chat Doctor. If you are not get immunized for tetanus, you should start tetanus toxic vaccination now itself. First 2 doses at 4 weeks apart. Third dose after 6 months. After that your immunity may stand up to 10 years. Thank you.                                 Tetanus\n",

You have not provided your age on the details. I would have been able to help u better had you mentioned your age. You have complaints of chest pain radiating to back with strong family history. So in your case it is better that we evaluate you for presence of heart disease. I recommend an ECG and 2d echo initially. If both these tests are normal you can proceed for a treadmill test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously monitored. This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert. Wishing you good healthRegards.                 Coronary Artery Disease\n",

I started using RICHFEEL tricology centres saw palmetto treatment but it didnt help, then I tried Minoxidil 5%  but discontinued it after 12 days after having some side effects (some tiny boils on my forehead). Kindly suggest me which medicine i should take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi, You may stop it for a few days. Take oral treatment like tab finasteride 1 mg daily with tab biotin 10 mg thrice a day. Cleanse the scalp with ketoconazole shampoo daily. After a few days you may restart the minoxidil. Tiny boils may be folliculitis. Take a course of antibiotic like cap Doxycycline. Avoid stress and worries. Continue treatment for long time to get good result in an Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.                     Male Pattern Baldness\n",

You have to do x-ray chest as early as possible. Rib fractures can cause pneumothorax/air in chest or hemothorax/blood in the chest which will be seen on x-ray. Only rib fractures needs no treatment except painkillers. But if pseudo or hemothorax is present that needs ICD tube insertion in the chest. In that case air travel should be avoided.

I am a 16 yr. old male & have used snuff habitually before, for only a few years but none the less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Taking snuff for a prolonged period is not known to cause cancer, but it may lead to a number of local infections. Also, such people have a number of vitamin deficiencies which may also lead to irregularities in the cheeks and gums. I would advise you to take an antibiotic and antifungal (Tab Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily +Tab For can 150 mg twice daily) plus a multivitamin (Tab B-Complex twice daily), all for 15 days. If your bumps don't improve by then, you should consult a surgeon.                                  Cancer\n",

Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has well differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.  If her general health is good then treatment of choice is wide excision of carcinoma followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy if needed. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly.

Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor ! Lower back pain may cause by right lumber disc prolapse whicChatDoctorpresses the nerve. But exact other causes are diagnosed by physical examination or by MRI. Common causes of lower backache and leg pain is a lumbar ruptured disc or herniated disc. Symptoms of a herniated disc may include dull or sharp pain, muscle spasm or cramping, sciatica, and leg weakness or loss of leg function. Sneezing, coughing, or bending usually intensify the pain. Rarely bowel or bladder control is lost, and if this occurs, seek medical attention at once. Sciatica is a symptom frequently associated with a lumbar herniated disc. Pressure on one or several nerves that contribute to the sciatic nerve can cause pain, burning, tingling, and numbness that extends from the buttock into the leg and sometimes into the foot. Usually one side (left or right) is affected. Take care                           Herniated Disc\n",

Taking mucinex, third antibiotic, inhaler and can not get better. Ulcers in mouth and my face in breaking out bad. Been sick since December 28,2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The reasons for persistent cough, without findings in the lungs might, Uveitis a growth at the end of the throat, by touching the pharynx cause severe cough. For this type of cough you need to use cough suppressants like dexametarphane, codeine, etc which are present in some cough syrups.  Best thing to get relief immediately is Darling with Luke warm salt water 2 or 3 times a day. Avoid taking fruits, juices, ice creams, ice water to Chat Doctor.  I advise you to consult an E.N.T.surgeon who is the doctor concerned with the causes in the pharynx.  Wishing for a quick and comfortable relief, and thanks for calling.

Yesterday the doctor was quite concerned at how her blood pressure was so high, and then a couple of weeks go when she had her smear, it was too low. She has now got this bruising appearing around her lower back too, and i don t know how its been caused. I m really worried about her. Is this seriouse?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Hello, I would explain that a heart murmur could be related a structural heart abnormality.  For this reason, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound and a resting ECG in order to examine her heart function and structure.  Considering her blackout attacks, I would recommend performing some tests too:- complete blood count for anemia,- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance.  An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help examine her heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.                            heart related\n",

I can understand your concern. You taken percent, clonazepam, Zoloft, Adderall so in my opinion you should avoid alcohol. It will damage the liver and will put you in trouble. You should check your liver enzymes levels once and also go for ultrasound abdomen once to rule out any alcoholic liver disease. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubts then feel free to ask me. I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.                    Liver Related Issues\n",

I had withdrawal bleeding 12/9/13 - 12/13/13.I was supposed to get my period 1/5/14 but i am late. Before birth control my cycles were always regular and always 28-29 days. My boyfriend and i have been using the pullout method frequently before and after stopping the pill. Could i be pregnant?  Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.  However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue.                                Pregnancy\n",

Body is too much fluctuating, at times i feel better and at times i feel pathetic. I am on complete rest, at times i walk around else not much of physical work.

HelloThanks for asking query on HC. I presume that you have been diagnosed with acute hepatitis E based on the relevant tests. You must know that acute hepatitis E is a self limiting disease, only needs supportive care. You are correctly started on Mongolia (UCA), please continue that, no need to change to Liv 52. Furthermore, you may also require acid suppressing and antiemetic tablets like - Antacid DSR along with some vitamin supplements. Have good quality food with necessary proteins and vitamins. You will become normal in another weak. Mind you bilirubin is the last thing to normalize. So don't worry about that. Alarm signs which one should keep in mind are - excessive sleepiness, bleeding manifestations and inability to eat anything. Take care.                               Hepatitis\n",

Can be very disturbing to get your entire household infested by scabies. Hygiene is the rule. Treating every sick person, washing and disinfection all linen as well as ironing would ensure that this bug is gotten rid of. So step up your personal hygiene after treating every affected individual and disinfecting all linen. I hope this ad Chat Doctor.  Feel free t ask for more information if needed.

I think they are panic or anxiety attacks, but who knows. I get a tight feeling in the back of my head that moves to my temples then down into my throat and eventually down the middle of my chest. I get very emotional when this happens and after all that, I can t catch my breath and my heart beats really fast. It usually goes away in 2 or 3 minutes, if I can sit down and concentrate on my breathing. I recently had an MRI and my heart was found to be OK......any ideas????

       "38  Dear doctor, i am 33 male recently i have undergone pre employment medical check up and it was found that i have sgpt- 194 except this all test are absolutely normal test includes 1) CBC2. ESR and liver test 3. Urine Routine 4. Blood Group & Rh Factor 5. X-ray (Chest)6. General Physical Examination7. Fasting Blood Sugar &Post Prandial Blood Sugar8. Total Cholesterol9. ECG10. Serum Creatininenow they have advised me to got my ultrasound done full abdomen. i have got it done today and every thing is normal and they found mild fatty liver. Another thing i want to share that i was suffering from loose motions and was on Ofloxacin-200mg with ornidazole500mg B.D dosage (oflox OZ )medication for 2days and continued ofloxacin-200 B.D dosage (oflox) for another 3days as was suffering cold and cough also.now i need to go to gastro doctor to get the ultrasound reports checked. Just want to know what could be the reason for this elevated SGPT and will i get the clearance for joining new company.what should i do to lower my SGPT levels?? and what diet i should follow i am not a heavy drinker just take drinks occasionally and i am not fond of junk food as well.                                                                                                                                                                      Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!                    Liver Related Issues\n",

Thanks for sharing your concern. The roots of upper molars are in very proximity with the maxillary sinus above.Therefore, sometimes it becomes difficult to diagnose whether the patient presents pain due to tooth infection or sinusitis. But clinical evaluation with supporting x-rays makes it clear whether the origin of infection is teeth or sinus.Therefore, in my view please meet your dentist/ENT specialist for a sinus view x-ray. This will make things pretty clear.Meanwhile, do take good care of yourself.ET us know for further doubts. Thanks. Take care.                               Infection"

Take hot water fomentation in the back and also keep your leg elevated over pillow. You should also take tablet Pregabalin M one daily. This will decrease nerve edema and also take care of the pain.  I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks</td>\n",

If you are a typical OCD client, then you should have been advised about OCD fully. It is mandatory. The stress goes with OCD, and it is easily overcome. As long as your memory is concerned, it is not failing. It actually is overwhelmed. You are preoccupied with obsessional thoughts which fails your memory. OCD clients should learn how to tackle this, how to think away from obsessive thoughts. You might need OCD therapy and other behavioral therapies.

In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal cause for your chest discomfort. Your chest discomfort is associated with exertion (playing tennis), so musculoskeletal cause is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal discomfort. 1. Avoid awkward movements. 2. Sit with proper back and chest support. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.</td>\n",

So, as your old physician suggested you need not have to worry about it. You need to have some lifestyle modifications to reduce the level of ALT. Daily physical exercise, eat healthy balanced diet preferably fresh fruits and vegetables which contain several anti-oxidants that help in reducing the ALT, AVOID ALCOHOL if any, avoid fatty vegan and non-vegan meals, fast junk foods, take plenty of oral fluids. INSA Allah, in due course of time your ALT will be normal. Wishing you best of your health.</td>\n",

Ill be fine for a little bit then all of a sudden my stomach starts to hurt again. its causing my back to hurt right behind the abdominal pain. Any idea?  Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, after a clinical assessment of your abdomen and back along with a general physical examination, I would advise you for some routine blood tests like a CBC, blood sugar, serum amylase and lipase, an LFT, blood urea, serum creatinine, an ECG and some radiological investigation like an ultrasound of whole abdomen, X-ray chest and abdomen in upright posture, followed by a CT scan if need be. In the meanwhile, I would relieve your pain with some anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor.  Further management would depend on the result of clinical assessment and the investigation reports.

Hi, my names Will, im 14 years old and ive found a white sort of spot attached to my scrotum, this morning it was rubbing and began to bleed to i put a small plaster on to stop the discomfort. I havent a clue what it is and havent taken the plaster off since.

Hello, Force spots happen when sebaceous glands, which moisturize your skin and are usually covered by your outer layer of skin, become enlarged and appear as tiny white spots.  These spots are harmless. They can appear almost anywhere on your body, including your scrotum and penis. Therefore, I suggest consulting a skin specialist for physical examination, diagnosis and treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care    Unknown\n",

I get very bad headaches with certain smells. Mostly red onions. I work with a culture of people who don t want to take me seriously when I ask them to omit bringing onions to the office. I can eat them ok if they are cooked well but the smell causes headache and tightened throat and chest. How can I make them understand that this is hurtful when they do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It may be difficult to change the diet of other persons. You may want to print out information on headache triggers to show that your issue is a real and documented one. If possible, you may need to evacuate the area when these foods are brought in. Your doctor would be able to give you medication to help relieve your discomfort, you can keep it with you. I hope this helps   Unknown\n",

I am a cheerleader so I am flexible and do many different stretches and flexibility training daily, so today during a tryout I went into my right splits and heard three very loud pops and then very bad pain! I continued with my tryout which had several different jumps and kicks and with each I felt even more pain and now I am feeling constant pain on minimal movements.

Hi... As per your narration you had injured your muscle...there could be snapping of muscle over the bone or could be a partial tear in the muscle. Nothing to worry. If I were you... I would wait for a while and.... Apply lot if ice in the injured area... frequently for every 2 hours once for 15mins... No stretching to the injured area for next 48 hours...Don't load for next couple of days. Support the injured area witChatDoctorpression bandage... Once movements becomes pain-free then do strengthening exercises for gluteus and then slowly and progressively load the injured area...like moving your leg from out to inside...etc Hope this is helpful for you... Kindly revert.in case you need any further help in this regard...   Unknown\n",

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Clitoris is a part of female genitals which is a regressed meaning shrunken form of male penis ( male sexual organ). Its normally seen as a small bud like thing in the upper part of female vagina. In some abnormal situation, it enlarges(hypertrophy) and looks very prominent then it's called clitoral hypertrophy. Your doctor did right by asking for endocrine consult because there can be a lot of reasons for it, and she needs a detail evaluation. Hope that clarifies your doubt as of now. Happy to help further. Take care.   Unknown\n",

HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctorI have gone through your query. It is normal to have ejaculation while sleeping if you don't masturbate. You don't need to worry about that.

Can hyperinflated lungs be normal? I got my x-ray result :Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD, no other any medical  problem concert. I have never had  any illness. I had x-ray last year that result is normal. The doctor said I may can not work in a nursing home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. If you are not having any symptoms (cough, breathlessness, chest pain) then no need to worry about hyperinflated lung field on chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is taken after deep inspiration then hyperinflated lung field can be seen on the chest x-ray. COPD diagnosis is not only on the basis of chest x-ray. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) is needed for diagnosis of COPD. If you have any doubt then get done PFT.PFT is normal then no need to worry about COPD and you can also work in nursing home. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.   Unknown\n",

Dear DoctorMy mum has congestive heart failure and has been taking as a diuretic Frusemide 40mg daily.  Just recently the nurse at the heart failure clinic added in Spironolactone 12.5mg daily but the Frusemide dose is the same.  Is it normal that 2 different diuretics are prescribed to be taken concurrently and also will this have any reaction with the Candesartan that she takes as well? How often must her urea & electrolyte levels be checked now?Thankyou for your help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hi, If your mother doesn't have kidney failure, it is a good idea to prescribe Spironolactone and Furosemide together. Spironolactone will not let to a big Chat Doctor.  It is Ok to take them together with Candesartan. I would advise you to check electrolytes once monthly, after 3 months, if they are stable, then you can check it once in 3 months.

The measurements give an estimate of weeks but, a variability from the actually calculated date can be present, as ultrasound only gives a rough estimate. So in effect the ultrasound findings can be plus or minus 1 week in first trimester; 2 weeks in second trimester; and more than two weeks in third. This variability is decreased with newer machines but can't be totally removed. So I would say that this report is absolutely reassuring, and you should not worry at all. A good fetal heart rate and a placenta which is only grade 1 maturity indicates that everything is as it should be at this stage. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.   Unknown\n",

As far I am getting you are having trouble with burning pain with unexplained metallic taste of mouth, how about your weight are you obese and addiction of alcohol and smoking as your symptoms are suggestive of GOOD. You must avoid smoking, excess alcohol and coffee after food donor lie down immediately. And in sleeping slight head elevation will prevent burning to metallic taste along with spicy food abstinence. Also start Spy Davison 10ml three times along with Santa or Gases for regular 15 days hope it will help if not then be needing Castro consult   Unknown\n",

Lump in the armpit / axillary region without pain, tenderness suggestive of lymph nodal enlargement at first place and lipoma, vascular causes on the second place.2. If you are my patient I would have examined first and ask for an ultrasound axillary region - ultrasound will give me the nature of the disease, its source and extensions.3. Lymph nodal enlargement is seen because of the underlying medical conditions any infections / inflammation it can be localized or systemic or possible lymph nodal pathology itself (lymphadenopathy)4. So one has to find out the cause - if required FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology will gel to evaluate the cause and cells involving.5. I can understand your financial status, but this is the standard procedure one has to follow. Try the way you can do so. Good luck. Hope I have answered your query.Anything to ask do not hesitate.

Hello, The blood vessels that supply the inner ears and the parts of the brain that are connected with the balance of the body pass through the cervical vertebrae.  Cervical spondylosis which is the usual cause of the pain in that region for which you received the steroid injection also affects these blood vessels and causes alteration in the blood flow which results in dizziness. Physiotherapy along with the use of certain medicines will reduce this dizziness. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.    Unknown\n",

Hello, I have studied your case. Pain in the forearm can be due to weakness or can be due to overuse. You have not told me in detail about your other illness. I would suggest you get a compression bandage for forearm and avoid putting pressure on one side. You can also take Broken tablet for pain relief. Hot water fomentation and Volition gel are also helpful. I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other follow-up questions. Thanks   Unknown\n",

Hi,2 days before i went to Sehat Clinic (Chennai, India) for hair loss problem. The doctor witnessed me and prescribed two tablets named \"Nano Hair Revitalizer & VB7 Forte\". I have not yet started taking those tablets, i have a question whether is there any side effects taking those tablets?Please answer my question..Thanks,Suresh S                                              DearWelcome to Chat Doctor ! Your details have been evaluated, and I find that certain vital details are missing. If I were your dermatologist, I would have asked you detailed history, examined you and the affected hairs, got some investigations done to substantiate your diagnosis. Most common causes of hair loss are halogen effluvium in which there is diffuse hair loss from all over scalp and the other one is An Chat Doctor. These two are common causes, but other diseases have to be ruled out by history and examination. In my opinion, it is recommended that first a diagnosis is made, and then proper treatment is instituted. I request you to provide the other required details so that your hair can be as healthy as those of normal person of your age. In the meantime, please avoid massaging too vigorously, have a healthy diet, adequate rest, and use a mild shampoo once or twice a week. This will surely aid in early recovery. Best wishes.

Hello, I have studied your case and most probably you are having disc herniation with nerve compression in the spine. I would recommend you to get some rest. Take hot water fomentation in the back and also keep your leg elevated over pillow. You should also take tablet Pregabalin M one daily. This will decrease nerve edema and also take care of the pain.  I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks   Unknown\n",

My memory is hopeless, I can give a shop assistant my card and then stress straight away wondering what I have done with it. I know I have to be on medication because I really struggle otherwise but was wondering if I can decrease my dosage or try another medication. Thank you.

I suggest you not to worry too much. If you are a typical OCD client, then you should have been advised about OCD fully. It is mandatory. The stress goes with OCD, and it is easily overcome. As long as your memory is concerned, it is not failing. It actually is overwhelmed. You are preoccupied with obsessional thoughts which fails your memory. OCD clients should learn how to tackle this, how to think away from obsessive thoughts. You might need OCD therapy and other behavioral therapies. I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological help through Chat Doctor. Contact me through customer care, www.ChatDoctor .com. Hope this clears your some doubts.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry about heart diseases as your 2d echo and TMT (trade mill test) are normal. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal cause for your chest discomfort. Your chest discomfort is associated with exertion (playing tennis), so musculoskeletal cause is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal discomfort. 1. Avoid awkward movements. 2. Sit with proper back and chest support. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.   Unknown\n",

Numbness in the toes indicate that there is some sort of neurological disturbance (impaired conduction of nerve impulse) in the involved nerves. This may result due to compression of the nerve at some level during its course or may also result due to some systemic diseases.

I have an ALT (SGPT) of 61, but my other Lever function tests are within normal ranges. Should I be concerned, or is my old physician right that it is no big deal? He is significantly older and seeming dismissive in general since I don t look sick.                                                                                                                                                                                               Thanks for posting your concern on Chat Doctor! I appreciate your concern towards the high ALT (SGPT) level. Age, gender, problem for which ALT is advised, and its duration, alcohol intake if any are not mentioned. Normal Adult Range for ALT : 0 - 48 U/Therefore, ALT in your case is slightly elevated. So, as your old physician suggested you need not have to worry about it. You need to have some lifestyle modifications to reduce the level of ALT. Daily physical exercise, eat healthy balanced diet preferably fresh fruits and vegetables which contain several anti-oxidants that help in reducing the ALT, AVOID ALCOHOL if any, avoid fatty vegan and non-vegan meals, fast junk foods, take plenty of oral fluids. INSA Allah, in due course of time your ALT will be normal. Wishing you best of your health.   Unknown\n",

       "544  If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.  I have been in extreme pain from a brachial plexus nerve avulsion C 7,8 ,T1,2 and spi.since 2003.  The meds Ive been taking 3600 mg.Gab, 100 mg. Methadone, 40 mg. Baclofen and 30 mg. Cymbalta cover about 50% of the pain. My Pain Specialist has been pressuring me for years for a scs implant for years and I finally agreed, however I then find out I have to wait 1 year to see the Neurosurgeon. This is suppose to be the best pain clinic in Ontario St. Josephs Hospital London Ontario. Problem is all or most of the info from people on online forms who have spinal cord stimulator implants are not as positive as the Doctors. Do any Doctors available have any direct knowledge on this subject ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Hi, Thank you for posting your query. It is unfortunate that you have been suffering from neuropathic pain for more than 10 years, and various pain medications have only partially helped you. I did not see pregabalin (lyrics) in your list of medications used. If that is the case, you can give pregabalin a try, as many people improve with that. Regarding spinal cord stimulator, it is an excellent option for pain control, however, just like other pain relief measures, it succeeds only in a proportion of patients. In the best pain centers, ACS implant may succeed in only about 60-70% of people. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/   Unknown\n",

Hi, my brother has dengue and his platelets count went on 93K when he was admitted. Next day count raised to 1.6K but now it has come to 43K on third day. Do I have to worry as he is hospitalised and seems doctors are not taking it serious. Please advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hi, Sorry to hear about your brother and also appreciate your concern. The number of platelet count in dengue is of prognostic value;it means that it tells us how the disease is progressing and if platelet count has come down to 43K from 1.6K in one day, it should be followed up keenly although in my opinion a retest is a must. If it goes down further, he may need platelet infusion. Please talk to the doctor and keep an eye over the platelet count and the overall condition of your brother. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to ask another question if there is another query. Thanks, Chat Doctor.    Unknown\n",

I would advise you to undergo upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy if medical treatment does not help you.

Welcome to Chat Doctor You need t apply sunscreen lotion of SPF 25 at least for protection from UV rays from sun. Try to avoid sun exposure. Use colored umbrellas for protection from sun. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables every day as they have antioxidants and vitamins that prevent damage to skin.  Chat Doctor.  Exercise every day for 40 minutes by brisk walking which is enough to improve blood circulation to skin and make it glow. If you have any pigmentation on your face that can be removed by many methods like bleaching creams, laser etc. Consult your Dermatologist to get further information.   Unknown\n",

Dear Sir,I am 23. I am  feeling pain in my stomach (left side) since last couple of days. Pain is not more but light. I would like to share hat days back around 2008 i had a pain in my stomach and i checked it and found Appendicitis. it was small in size around.2mm so doctor  recommend me to take injection. I took that and felt relax. Now i am feeling same problem. so please recommend me that what to do now?i am quite afraid that whether i got that problem again?what is the probability of severity on this??I ll be grateful if you will give me some solution on that.Best RegardsDharmendra Tripathy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hi Carmen Chat Doctor. It looks that you have got colitis. A proper history, clinical examination, investigations as per these findings alone can lead to a proper diagnosis. This is most important to lead to a proper management/ treatment. So visit a Doctor, preferably general surgeon. All you need is a 5-day course of antibiotic, metronidazole and supportive medicines, and you will be fine. Do not panic and do not think this as a serious problem.   Unknown"
