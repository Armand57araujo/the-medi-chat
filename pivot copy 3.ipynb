       "      <td>hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive. medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. the only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like oxycodone do not have this effect. so there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication. the best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. i hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,</td>\n",

       "      <td>hallow dear, since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. in this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. however, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period earlier, the test may report false negative. alternatively, you may perform beta chat doctortor test on the blood. this will help you detect your pregnancy status. if you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like devilry for 5 days (with advice of a gynecologist). then within 4-7 days, you should get with chat doctortor. however, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. i hope this clarifies the issue.</td>\n",

      "59425   hi, i have been sick for about 4 years now. have had this intermittent illness, with severe body aches deep inner pain like someone beat me inside with a baseball bat at times, with even this chronic sore throat on one side of my throat....and feels like i have a low grade fever with it too. it is aweful! been going on intermittently for years now, and when i take american ginseng it goes away? when i stop taking it it returns and feels even worse. i have thyroid but have my blood tested every 6 months, just did a few days again again and my doctortor says my thyroid levels are normal and i am not anemic. my dad had pernicious anemia so i told my doctor and he said the blood work he did on my blood had no warning signs for that either. i used to work in maine as a gardener for over 10 years and worry maybe lyme disease or some other more serious auto immune disease? i also had a bad hiatal hernia but this started to happen to me way before the hernia got worse or i had symptoms with the hernia, so i don t think it is the hernia. i worry it is something far more serious and i can not get into see a new doctortor for 2 months as i live in a rural area and it is not good. i went for a 6 month stretch where i felt better, no symptoms at all, but i also left the town i live in and went to florida for a while and i notice that when i get out of the town i live in, i feel better too?? not sure if the air is bad here or the water?? i am at my wits end and have no clue what i may have or how serious?? please help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  your history suggests (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms.(2) you need to go for thorough workup like throat culture and sensitivity test, allergy panel test, other test which may be required after your physical exam.(3) best option is when you get complaints next time, you go to a good medical facility and consult internal medicine physician about your off and on complaints. internal physician would do physical examination and suggest further course most likely as i mentioned by me in 1  2  (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms                      disease, allergy, anemia, thyroid, fever, blood, throat, blood test, ear, illness, test, pain\n",

      "138  i ve have allergy sinus problems year round. i ve developed a horrible cough over the past almost two months. my doctortor gave me a round of antibiotics that i finished about 2 weeks ago. it definitely helped with the heavy feeling i had in my chest and the cough (a little) but the cough is back full force now. i hear some wheezing when laying down, as this is when the cough is worse. i do smoke and am trying to quit. now, after about a week, i ve developed pain in my right collarbone area and neck. it is uncomfortable all the time but when i cough it actually hurts, also when i lift my armshoulder as well. any suggestions on next steps with my doctortor???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      you are suffering from allergy and smoking is making it worse. you seem to be suffering from copd as well. your description suggests that you may have had a bout of chest infection which is not completely cured and hence you have developed symptoms again. you need to undergo some tests like a basic blood count and a chest x-ray to start with. it will help in ruling out pneumonia or any other pathology. consult a pulmonologist who can advise you correctly and also treat you properly.      copd as well  allergy, bone, pneumonia, blood, infection, ear, test, pain      copd as well\n",

      "240                 hi, i was at my allergist today and was very congested, runny stuffy nose, sneezing as a result of being off my allegra for four days prior to the subdermal allergy testing she did today. i showed no reaction to any of the environmental allergens tested for, but to help me out she gave me a small cup full of liquid prednisone , an allegra tablet and some nasal spray (she said earlier would not aggravate my existing benign heart irregular beat i get from time to time.) that was at noon today. then tonight at 5pm i started suddenly getting an increased heart rate along with bad irregular beats (pvcs i believe from past experience). three hours later i am still getting them. can these be a result of the prednisone the allergist gave me? i told her i had a history of benign irregular heart beats and couldn t take any nasal sprays that had a decongestant effect because of my heart. that is why i m surprised she gave me prednisone which i just read online can cause palpitations and rapid beat. do you think the one dose of prednisone caused this fast beat and irregular heart beats and, if so, will it subside soon or by morning? thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           hello, there is in fact very little evidence to suggest prednisolone can set off premature ventricular contractions but certainly can set off palpitations if the dose was higher than required. some patients with a chat doctortor. you have not mentioned the dose you had, or whether you took it on an empty stomach or without ppi cover. gastritis is a problem when taken on an empty stomach, and that set off palpitations. it should subside within 24 hours, but if you still feel unwell, i would suggest you get seen by a physician as soon as possible for an ecg and a thorough evaluation. thanks.                                                                                                                 gastritis                allergy, heart, nose, ear, stomach, test                                                                                                                 gastritis\n",

      "442  hello dr, my baby got infected with bronchitis at age of 9. he was dehydrated and was hospitalized, dr started antiboitic along with nebulization with medicine ventolin, clenil and atermentatem . may be got better in a week and after 2 to 3 week nebulization process he was 100 well but as he is turn 11 he got infected again with, dr said its same sort of illness with some effect of pneumonia ( may be bronchiolitis ) this time, may be stopped taking milk , it was very difficult for us to handle, as we were worried of dehydration. then we use salinase drop and he started taking diet. what i wanted to know, is it normal to get infected with such issues like we do with flu , cough etc? or getting infected again and again is an issue ? its not easy to find baby breathing very difficulty so i am very worried, please advice, what we can do avoid such thing later, do formula milk cause this. also dr this time started piriton syrup. thanks                                                                                                                  it appears that your baby is 11 months old and not 11 years old. if this is correct, attacks of bronchiolitis are due to virus known as rsv and this can happen recurrently and even lead to childhood asthma. you should follow your doctortors advice and use nebulization as often as needed to stop his breathing problems. no one really knows whether food or milk can contribute to the problem as the major cause is the rsv virus and not milk. do not change his milk unless you have had your son tested for milk protein allergy.      asthma           allergy, pneumonia, ear, illness, test, asthma            asthma\n",

      "1451  i ve had patella femoral syndrome for 20 years now and have tried everything the doctortors have given me. physical therapy, knee braces, knee taping, prescription medicine both for pain and swelling. my question is what can be done that goes above and beyond this form of treatment? the last few years it has gotten really bad to the point i no longer do anything that requires long periods of standing, walking, and even sitting. i no longer play any type of sports because my knees either give out or lock up on me with no given warning. this has become a daily norm for me lately. i m 45 now and find myself falling on occassion because of this. i m also having trouble sleeping at night because of the intense pain which now has become a 247 burden in my life. please help! i m a veteran that goes through the va for medical and am afraid that they either minimize the severity of my issue and or they don t really know what to do about it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 here i suggest doing more of strengthening exercise with mobility exercise based on your knee problem and knee biomechanics. you have mention here there is a knee pain. and you are not comfortable using knee braces. but i need to know what kind of knee issue you have?does it early stage or chronic stage of knee oslo arthritis?, or is it pain related to knee cap movement disorder?. based on this only i can suggest specific things. but still i must suggest you to visit a good physio and take proper treatment which can reduce inflammation and relax your soft tissue. as well also take a good exercise program to strengthen the knee joint. in very sever knee pain i also suggest taking mri and check what is going wrong inside. and based on the report do visit orthopedic for having opinion on surgery or for minor issues on medication. also use hot and cold pack regularly and frequently to have more of anti-inflammatory, relaxing and soothing effect on joint. take care.  arthritis  arthritis, disorder, therapy, medication, mri, surgery, joint, ear, treatment, inflammation, syndrome, pain         arthritis\n",

      "1848  diagnosed with fibromyalgia 20 yrs ago. long history of migraines, back and neck pain. physio, traction, neck crunching in past. 63 yrs female. take half 25 mg endep, imigran and panadol osteo. slow loss of fine motor skills in right hand affecting writing. hand seizes after 3 letters. fm pain worsened by physical activity (when aching), stress, especially weather changes. presently have neck pain worsened by tilting head back. pain worsened by laying on neck in bed at night. at times find that imigran (sumatriptan) eases neck pain - does this indicate blood vessel entrapment as action of imigran seems to ease pain in neck at times, when other medication doesn t do anything. work in school, which requires twisting, turning etc. cold winter at present in adelaide, south aust which exacerbates pain, although i find repeatedly that my best health and least pain occurs in autumn every year. get light-headed and dizzy at times. fell off a low platform onto knees and fainted 2 years ago  excruciating calf pain at night - got up screaming and fainted. ultrasound revealed clot, suggested warfarin immediately. i didn t take, sought further advice, saw vascular surg, more bloods taken, then just aspirin at night. took for a while, but not now - bad press recently. do not have regular gp. see when need scripts. medical clinic situation rather than family gp. fm mainly self-management. was secretary of arthritis foundation support group initially and learnt a lot about fm but haven t kept up with latest for a while now. just push on, but neck pain is very restrictive and has been constant for a month now, with just occasional relief - probably due to pills rather than abating of problem. don t know whether to ignore and hope it gets better, or get some massage, or go down gp line and seek specialist assessment. am not one who rushes to doctortor as over time fm patients usually learn to not expect any answers for pain. think i ve got to a point of head in the sand self treatment now. seem to be conflicting attitudes to value of mri as a friend had for neck probs. i keep looking at barometer hoping it s the reason for pain - perhaps foolish, but when people have conditions for which there is no magic answer or treatment or reasons one becomes complacent i guess. just wondering whether i should be seeking some answers to this neck problem as it s starting to concern me re pain and constrictions. have irregular heart rhythms also which were considered by cardio to have contributed to faints and dizziness. still trying to work in a primary school setting but becoming difficult, although it does force activity and movement. cope with back pain but this neck pain is a bit more concerning when any slight backwards tilt causes compression and more pain flare-up. daughter aged 38 yrs also has had pain in arms and legs, with hand tingling and heavy aching for many years. no-one has ever really investigated this or given any reasons to her. she had dysgerminoma ovarian cancer with ovary removed at just 13 yrs. 12 mths later another laparotomy to remove other ovary. turned out to be a haemorrhage of ovary, so it was left. due to abdominal surgery, she got lypodaemia. probably more related reason is surgery re arm pain, but thought i d mention also. basically, how much should one be concerned re neck pain?? thankyou so much. hw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     hi.u should be concerned as it was making u daily routine difficult .account to your given history i migraine fibromyalgia im ina out that u may be suffering from cervical spondylosis why dont u try an app and lateral radiograph of c spine which role outs any abnormality or canal stenosis.u should continue your migraine prophylaxis under the supervision of your physical as it ha many aggravating factors in your case.the same applies tour daughter also to have a radiograph done and take to your radiologist and ask h8m whether to have any further radiological investigation.   migraine  arthritis, medication, mri, heart, ultrasound, surgery, ovary, nose, blood, migraine, fibromyalgia, spine, ear, treatment, test, pain, cancer          migraine\n",

      "2550  hi,last april, i hurt my left knee playing basketball. they first told me it was a 2nd degree tear of medial collateral ligament. after about 2 weeks, i went to physical therapy for a while. then in august as it was not getting better, i got an mri and it shows a very very small tear of meniscus and some arthritis in left knee.i have let it rest and light exercises for 8-12 months before recently going back to being active.the problem is my left knee is still not right. hurts most if i sit and try to bend leg. also hurt getting out of bed in morning. it sounds like i am a machine with the cracking and popping.i have now scheduled another appointment.any ideas? did tear get bigger?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  hias you mentioned now that you have a meniscal tear and have undergone physical therapy also. i think you need to go back to the exercises again. start with taking a hot fermentation and slow and gradual static hams and quads. along with it try to slowly bend the knee how much you can and gradually process to full range of motion. if the pain is little high you can undergo ultrasound therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for pain relief and inflammation reduction. once the pain levels come down please focus on specific training for football players for strengthening the knees as you should be precaution in future to avoid injuries. i am sure you will be helped like my other patients who do excellent on field after the rehabilitation process. god bless you  inflammation                                    arthritis, therapy, mri, ultrasound, nerve, ear, inflammation, pain      inflammation\n",

      "2649  a few months ago, i noticed the middle finger on my left hand started getting stuck in the closed position when i would wake up in the morning. i also noticed there is a small bump at the inner base of that finger. after doing some research online, i found that this might be pointing toward arthritis (specifically trigger finger ). i am 33 years old, so this seemed odd to me, but i made a mental note and went about my business. plus, it started getting a little better as time went on. recently, i ve found that anytime i sleep on my left arm it starts to go numb and tingle (it falls asleep ). this has been going on for about a week, or so. and, for a couple of days within that timeframe, my left pinkie finger would tingle throughout the day. that sensation has gone away, but my arm still falls asleep when i lay on it. i am young (33), athletic (slendermuscular 230lbs, 6 5 ) and have always thought of myself as a generally healthy person, but this is starting to worry me a bit. i have thought this might be stress related, as i ve been working long hours at work, or that maybe i just need to get more sleep, as i am lacking in that area, as well. any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated. thank you!  hi, dear,welcome to chat doctortor. based on the facts and data of your query, you seem to have a complex problem from the disturbed forearm compartments, mostly due to the-overwieght issues with service spondylitis and due to the hypothyroid entrapment of the forearm nerves  or could be due to the? rheumatic nodule with synovitis, on the base of the left-hand middle finger  or could be due to the accompanied dupeutrans contracture, which may start like this or due to the psoriasis teno-synovitis of the left hand. all these possibilities would need to be ruled out by check up with and second opinion from your physician or with your orthopedic doctortor or sports doctortor, as you are an athlete. remedy-1-check out with ortho-surgeon and physician team if need be, would be needed to find out the cause of the stuck middle finger with nodule at the base of the left middle finger. only after proper x-ray and ct study of the indicated parts as advised from orthosurgeon, you could get the correct treatment either with the medicines and or with the surgical correction if need be.2-at 33 with 6ft 5 inches, you are still overweight, though muscular, and need to reduce on at least 20 kg to reduce the load on the hormonal system, which appears to be stressed with the stressed immune system, which seems to be causing this teno-synovitis or rheumatic problem in your upper arm and hand. hope this reply would help you to resolve your sever anxiety. welcome for any further query in this regard will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at chat doctortor. good day!! chat doctortor. s. genl-cvts     anxiety           arthritis, thyroid, nerve, ear, treatment           anxiety\n",

(2.5ml only in night). shall i continue that whenever he feels cold  cough? i am afraid of side effects for regular use of both the medicines. please advise me..  thanks for your question on chat doctortor. i can understand your concern. recurrent cough, cold, wheezing etc. need thorough evaluation to rule out asthma. all these symptoms suggest allergic component and asthma can cause similar symptoms. so better to rule out asthma in his case. regular treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid is the treatment of choice for asthma. stalin is short-acting beta 2 agonists (saga). its action lasts for only 1-2 hours. so repeated dosing is required. and hence side effects like palpitations, tremors etc. are more. newer long acting beta 2 agonists (lab) are safe for long term use. so discuss all these with your doctortor and start appropriate treatment. hope i have solved your query. wishing good health to your son. thanks.              asthma  asthma, ear, treatment              asthma\n",

      "2864  hi my 3 yr old daughter has allergic bronchitis. she was on seroflow 125 (1 puff twice a day) for about 3 months. we had also tried levolin nebulization, montair antiallergic course for 2 months, but she kept having repeated wheezing problems. finally we switched to homeopathy about 2 months back. i am giving her astha aid syrup half teaspoon with water thrice a day, menostim tablets (4 tablets thrice a day). how effective is this treatment? what alternatives do i have?                      hello and welcome to chat doctortor. we are seeing an increase in pediatric cases of allergic bronchitis in our clinical practice in the last few years. the good news is that this sometimes corrects itself by the age of 10 yrs.also, homeopathy is a safe and reliable option for treating allergic bronchitis. astha aid syrup and muslim are helpful in controlling acute flare-ups. but the treatment should definitely include constitutional treatment (this is a personalized treatment chalked out after studying the case in detail by the treating doctortor). constitutional treatment can completely cure the tendency for recurring asthma attacks and also reduce the severity and frequency of future attacks. hope this solves your query. thanks and take care. chat doctortor.          bronchitis  asthma, ear, treatment          bronchitis\n",

      "3163  hi doctortor,my daughter aged 3 is frequently having cough problem (twice or thrice a month).sh had an attack of nephrotic syndrome when she was 2 and since 7to 8 months she is off steriods and is ok.now our doctortor has prescribed inhalers for her frequent cough problem.is it safe for her??????  hi....inhalers are safe if given for appropriate indication and at appropriate dose and duration. suggestions1. there are certainly alternative management therapies in allopatry now-a-days. medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100 controllable.2. inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. if i were your pediatrician i would have suggested the use of decor metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. another metered dose inhaler is leveling and this can use as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of decor. the technique is very important and very crucial for the chat doctortor. regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. so do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. the technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctortor and these are prescription medicines. so i suggest you consult your pediatrician for this.3. triggers can be environmental changes dust talcum powder seasonal changes uncleaned a  c vent cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - the best person is the parent. hope my answer was helpful for you. i am happy to help any time. further clarifications and consultations on chat doctortor are welcome. if you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. wish your kid good health.    asthma    asthma, syndrome, therapy            asthma\n",

      "3166                                hi! i started drinking the body by vi shakes about a month ago. in the last few weeks my asthma has become out of control, it was quite mild to begin with. the shakes were the only change i have made to my lifestyle. could i be allergic to them? please help! thanks!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     hi, vi shakes contain concentrate of proteins and these can be immunogen to you, or you can say that you are allergic to its constituent, so you should immediately stop its use anymore. to confirm it you may go for its patch test on your back. as your asthma tells about your atomic nature, and you might be allergic to several substances occurring in nature, so it is better to avoid it and all those which are allergic to you because then only your asthma can be managed.yew can go for complete panel allergen test to get a list of all allergic food to avoid any such episode in the future. thanks and take care.    asthma                 asthma, test            asthma\n",

      "3276  hello, my daughter has a lump on the back of one of her legs on her calf. she says it doesn t hurt when she walks but if she touches or rubs it, it hurts terribly. i ve already seen our doctortor and he says it must be some kind of infection that her body is fighting off. he gave her some antibiotics to take but she cannot take any antibiotics anymore because she has taken so much over the past few years. she gets so sick to her stomach and throws up. so, what do you think this is or is coming from? could it be a cist that should be removed? should she have an ultra sound? my daughter s immune system is very low. my husband and i adopted her from india when she was 3 years old and she was severely malnurished at the time. her health seems to be going down hill as she gets older. she is now 17. we have her on a good many vitamins already. our doctortor suggested that she have a vitamin profile blood testing done to see if she is lacking certain vitamins or minerals. maybe she is taking the wrong vitamins for her body. please help! thanks, bonnie albury  hi, dairy have gone through your question. i can understand your concern. lump on back of leg can be some cyst, abscess or soft tissue tumor. she should not take antibiotics without diagnosis. she should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. it will give you exact diagnosis. then she should take treatment accordingly. if she is malnourished then she should take high protein diet. check her vitamin profile and give her vitamin supplements according to need. hope i have answered your question, if you have doubt then i will be happy to answer. thanks for using chat doctortor. wish you a very good health.                                                          infection  biopsy, blood test, blood, tumor, infection, stomach, ear, test, treatment                                                          infection\n",

      "3373  two months ago i had a ct scan due to neck issues. they saw i had large lymph nodes approximately 2 centimeters. i then went to an ent and he couldn t feel anything so he wasn t able todo a biopsy so he sent me to a nearby facilities to have a sonogram on my neck to help for the biopsy. a biopsy was taken and the results came back good with no cancer involvement. i then went on november 18th to the ent cause he wanted to do a check up to make sure there is no growth. he felt no such growth and told me i am fine. recently however within the past two days. when i bend my neck down and but my chin on my chest if i move my head left or right i feel like a little bump right under my jaw. should i be concerned or am i just paranoid? like i said its been less then a month since i went to the ent.                                                                                                                                                       hi ! good afternoon. i am chat doctortor answering your query. although the feeling could be due to the scar tissue following the biopsy (if it was an open biopsy), i would definitely send you to the ent specialist for a review before you label your symptoms as paranoid. i hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physiciantreating doctortor in further management of your problem. please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. thanks for choosing chat doctortor to clear doubts on your health problems. wishing you an early recovery. chat doctortor.                                                                                         cancer           biopsy, ear, scan, cancer                                                                                         cancer\n",

      "3676  hi. im very concerned about my boyfriend. evidently he had a root canal done poorly over a decade ago when he was young, and now its caused a cyst on the roof of his mouth. hes getting the root canal redone tomorrow as well as a biopsy, but the doctortor says that there is significant bone degradation in the area. im scared. could this be life-threatening?  thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the cyst is not life-threatening, but it has to be treated properly. get the root canal treatment done followed bye nucleation of the cyst. then send the biopsy to histopathological examination to rule out from other lesions like benign tumors. if there is severe bone loss we can try placing bone like material(graft) after nucleation of the cyst and support the tooth. if there is no possibility of placing the graft and if tooth is mobile then it has to be removed. consult a good oral maxillofacial surgeon and get it done hope my answer will help you, take care.  bone loss we can try placing bone like material  biopsy, treatment, tumor, bone  bone loss we can try placing bone like material\n",

      "3822  hi i m 26 years old and i am currently pregnant, about 11 weeks along. when i got pregnant with my daughter two years ago i started to have severe dizzy spells that were followed by vomitting. this not only lasted thru my first pregnancy but i had experienced this for over 2 years in between pregnancies. i had brought it up many times to my doctortors and was ignored because they didn t see an issue. i call these episodes dizzy spells because that s the only thing i can compare it to... it is more of a physical feeling that starts in my stomach and works its way up to my head. it has always been random, sometimes multiple times a day and other are months apart. the feeling is so intense but only lasts a few minutes and is usually ending with vomitting. in between pregnancies it seemed like when this would happen i would stay seated and really still with my eyes closed and it would help stop the vomitting from happening. i ve done my research and understand most of the causes but i ve seen midwives, my pcp, my obgyn and multiple other doctortors with no luck for answers. is there anything i should be worried about or does this seem to resemble anything medical? i d just like some sort of answer so i know whether i should be worried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  hello, to me, your actual dizzy spells are related to pregnancy. thats normal. now, if youll experience again when not pregnant, then this is to get further investigated - do monitor your blood pressure and record the results for reference especially when you have the spells-do monitor your blood sugar levels to rule out hypoglycemia- have your meals regularly-check blood count to rule out anemia if nothing, then thyroid to check together with upper endoscopy for possible stomach problems. however, these are to get tested after giving birth if dizzy spells will continue. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctortor.                                                              anemia  birth, anemia, thyroid, test, blood, endoscopy, pregnant, eye, ear, pregnancy, stomach                                                              anemia\n",

      "4024  well..i am 30 year old man ,who is currently single and have never got married.i used to ejaculate so often though! that started around 8 years ago.at the beginning ,i did that like once a week ,but within the past 3 years ,i used to do it nearly everyday.i tried to give up ,but every time i decided that ,i only gave up for a week or maximum 9 days then back to the same dirty habits.my question is i heard that people who ejaculate so often will become barren and can not give birth to a baby. if i totally give up although i have done that for nearly 8 years ,is it still possible to give birth to a baby if i marry soon like within 6 months or after a year? i have never checked my semen ,so i do not know whether ejaculation has driven me to be barren or not ,but i recently heard that it is terrible and decided to give it up.and would be there any negative effects if i give it up forever? somebody said one time of ejaculation equals to making love with a lady for 12 times ,is that true?i am worried about myself.please reply me asap.you should take into account that i have no girl friend and i do not have sex with ladies,because my tradition prohibits me to do that with a lady who is not my wife.   hello dear,first, remove all myth and misconception from your mind regarding masturbation. there is no any harmful effects of masturbation as such. however, if it is done regularly then it will result in thinning of semen with low sperm count. since you are feeling that you are addicted to masturbation, and it is interfering with your normal functioning, you can try out the following measures1. improve your social life by spending more time with friends and relatives.2. keep your mind active and busy at all times either through curricular or extracurricular activities.3. have a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts  honey.4. avoid fast foods  lipid containing diet.5. avoid smoking  alcohol.6. stay away from pornograpchatdoctortoraterials.7. keep away stress, think positive.8. exercise regularly  practice meditation. wishing you a healthy lifetime care.       unspecified, conception                                   birth, conception, sperm, semen, ear       unspecified, conception\n",

      "4222  i started birth control (mid cycle, so not effective right away) recently and my package and doctortor said it will be effective without backup 7 days in. so, i took 7 pills consecutively and had unprotected sex the night after i had taken the 7th pill that morning. however, i realize this is technically six days, because the package says sunday to sunday whereas i did sunday to saturday, 7 pills but only 6 days. my partner did pull out as well, but i m still a little concerned. should i be worried about a pregnancy risk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                       hallow dear, you have to be worried. if you have started the pills midcycle, this cycle will not be protected. you will start getting the protection against pregnancy only from your next cycle, when your pills will be continuous from day 2 of the cycle. now, if you take two pills after the unprotected intercourse within 72 hours, you will get the same protection as post-coital emergency pill. beta chat doctortor test 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse will give you the reliable information of your pregnancy status. i would advise you to report to your gynecologist asap for further advice and any intervention if needed.   unspecified, pills       birth, ear, pregnancy, test   unspecified, pills\n",

      "4326  i have had sex several times this month. we used a condum everytime and i am also on birth control. i try to take my birth control on time but i dont always take it at the exsact same time. i usually take it in atleast a half an hour difference than the usual time tho. i am supposed to be on my period currently it was supposed to come yesterday. but today all i have gotten was clearwhite spit like consistancy fluid. it comes out quite often and i feel like i have my period because of cramps and achie pain. i have also noticed my blood sugar dropping very low through out the day. i have never noticed problems with my blood sugar before. could i be pregnant?  hi, i have read your query  understand your concern. blood sugar level depends on the food intake, pregnancy does not have any effect on blood sugar. except in case of diabetes gestational diabetes when blood sugar is raised in pregnancy. so low blood sugar can not be a sign of conception. your blood sugar might have lowered due to psychological stress leading to less eating. yes, in pregnancy vaginal discharge is increased than normal, but it also increases before  after menses. so just rise in vaginal discharge can not be a sign of pregnancy. half hour difference in consumption of pill. does not matter much. if you have not totally skipped a pill. in addition, you were using condom too. so there is rare chance of conception. any doubt can be ruled out by hpt after 8 days delay in period. thanks.                                                                                                                 diabetes  birth, gestation, vagina, conception, blood, pregnant, ear, pregnancy, pain, diabetes                                                                                                                 diabetes\n",

      "4523  hi.just call me shane from philippines.i just wanna ask about this thing i suffering at the moment.my bf took me to a doctortor just this last year.and go for that what they called enjection for birth control .that was my first time .the doctortor told me it takes only 3months and the enjection will be expired.and ,there s a possible i have no meanstruation or have a meanstruation but only a bit not strong.but since i go to that birth control enjection until now i still have bleeding .about two months already nonstop bleeding but the blood is not strong.what should i do to stop this bleeding?  hello, thanks for using chat doctortor. it is likely that you were injected a hormonal contraceptive which is a progesterone. demo proverb is a progesterone hormonal contraceptive that is injected by intramuscular route every 3 months. it however has side effects which include reduced menses and after a number of doses no menses, spotting or repeated mild blood discharges through the vagina, in some cases occasional heavy bleeding, weight gain, mood swing, headaches, abdominal discomfort, reduced libido etc. the degree of these side effects varies from individual to individual and could be severe necessitating a stop of the injections. however, once the injection has been given, only supportive treatment can be given as it will need just time for the chat doctortor. for your case, if you experience very heavy bleeding you need to see a doctortor, however, the repeated bleeding can improve upon subsequent injections with you not having your menses in later months. best regards and hope this helps you.                     that you were injected a hormonal contraceptive which is a progesterone                                                        birth, injection, vagina, blood, treatment, ear                     that you were injected a hormonal contraceptive which is a progesterone\n",

      "4625  i am 27 weeks pregnant (due april 14th) and i use to take antidepressants after my daught was born in july 2010 but i only stayed on them for a short while. i am now feeling like i may be suffering from depression again. can you tell me whats going on. i have trouble sleeping, tossing and turning and waking up all hours of the night. i cry for no reason somedays. i cant deal with things as well i use to for instance my sister brought her three children up for new years and the noisy made me feel so frustrated i was on the verge of crying. when i get too frustrated i either want to lie down and fall asleep or go on a cleaning spree. i do not feel suicidal or like i am going to harm my children or others but i do believe something is going on with me. is it depression or pregnancy hormones?  hi dear, i have gone through your question and i understand your concern. hormonal changes can also make you feel more anxious than usual. anxiety is another condition that can and should be treated during pregnancy. depression and anxiety may go undiagnosed because women often dismiss their feelings, chalking them up to the temporary moodiness that often accompanies pregnancy. so dont be shy about letting your doctortor or midwife know if you feel low. your emotional health is every bit as important as your physical health. and in fact, it can affect your physical health. risks of untreated anxiety and depression during pregnancy like low birth weight premature birth (before 37 weeks). but by just lifestyle modification you can avoid such situations, just feel well, avoid any stress, do activities which make you feel light and comfortable, if you dont feel happy while many peoples around you, or you are surrounded by loud noise then just avoid them, talk to people who are positive and to whom you love talking, watch television and talk with your close friends and take assistance if required, sharing your thoughts make you feel better so please dont shy to share them with your midwife for gp and if still not helpful then i will advise you to consult a qualified psychiatrist and to tell him about your anti depression medications which you were taking. psychiatry counselling will help you well because you are not alone and most of the cases seen in pregnancy are benefited by it. hope you find the answer helpful, please do get back for further queries i will be happy to assist you. wishing your good health. regards chat doctortor.                            depression                 birth, medication, nose, pregnant, ear, pregnancy                            depression\n",

      "4726  concerns for my daughter my daughter is two months old she was born after two days of being in labour and them breaking my waters n bringing my labour on by a drip then using the suction cup to pull her out after being dilated for two days when she was born i noticed she would shake her leg like a quiver but never thought much of it as i thought it might be her going to the toilet until a week later it mooved from that leg to her arm and mouth on the same side eventually it came to a point where her hole body would shake at time where i felt her spine shake and she would spew or have white frothy bubbles at her mouth i took her to see a peadiatrician who simply said it was a banine thing and she would grow out of it and it slowly stopped for a while but as of a week ago her legs and mouth have started to shake again but its not just that i have noticed she cant moove both legs at the same time she can only get one to moove with the other stopping half way the same thing with her arms she is also very stiff constantly and if her hands are open or closed when she goes stiff it takes her a while to close or open them again i have also noticed that her toes curl up and she cant uncurl them and has alot of trouble sleeping as in having to be held and as soon as you put her down she wakes up i took her to the doctortor again and two doctortors suggested i take her back to the peadiatrician as he was spose to do an ecg and blood test and she needs one done i want another opionion as to what another doctortor may think this all could be thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        hi.... by what you quote i feel your baby is having seizures. the history which you have provided regarding your pregnancy and associated complications during childbirth are also suggestive of the same. your baby will require evaluation for seizures in the form of eeg, and she might also require neuroimaging like ultrasound cranium or an mri brain. apart from this she will require metabolic work up like serum calcium magnesium and other electrolytes level in the blood. regards -                    seizures  birth, mri, ultrasound, blood test, blood, spine, brain, pregnancy, test                    seizures\n",

      "4825  so me qnd my husband are trying to conceive. i had sex twoevery two days starting two days before ovulating. at those times i expierienced light cramping, some diarrhea, and bloating. now five days before my period i woke to light spotting, only when using bathroom and now have cramps. ive read about implantation bleeding and am hoping this is what is occurring. the spotting has stopped and now i just have normal discharge. did we vet pregnant or am i just getting hopes up? i had a miscarriage last year but prior too i had other pregnancy symptoms like breast tenderness. i am not feeling that now but its onoy nine dqys after ovulation. please help me understand and what to look for in next couple of days! and if this is implantation occurring is there anythiny i can do to make the pregnancy more vialble? my email is yyyyyyyy i am 23 and not on birth control.                                                                                                                                                     hi and thanks for this query. trying to get pregnant often creates anxiety. i understand your feelings and concerns. this could be implantation bleed as well as it could be something totally unrelated to pregnancy. my advice now is that you stay patient and wait for the due date of your menses. if they do not come, then do a rapid urine pregnancy test and get the answer to this. if your menses should come, please dont get discouraged. getting pregnant is a continuous trial and takes luck. if it didnt happen this time around, it may as well happen the next time you try to. keep trying till you get pregnant. hope this helps. wish you success as you try to get pregnant.                       anxiety  birth, ovulation, pregnant, ear, pregnancy, test, miscarriage                       anxiety\n",

(which is important when determining) i had sex with my husband everyday in october until we split. then i slept with a friend on october 27th..one time. based on this info whos most likely my babies father?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   hi, i have gone through your question, and i think i have understood your concern. i will suggest you the best possible treatment options. in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. in your case it falls between 16 and 25 october. even if your november periods we expected on 7 november, ovulation day, will be around 23 october. i hope this information clears your doubt. still you can get dna paternity test, in case of any doubt after the birth of your baby. i hope this answer helps you. thanks chat doctortor.             my babies father?               birth, ovulation, pregnant, ear, treatment, test             my babies father?\n",

      "138  i ve have allergy sinus problems year round. i ve developed a horrible cough over the past almost two months. my doctortor gave me a round of antibiotics that i finished about 2 weeks ago. it definitely helped with the heavy feeling i had in my chest and the cough (a little) but the cough is back full force now. i hear some wheezing when laying down, as this is when the cough is worse. i do smoke and am trying to quit. now, after about a week, i ve developed pain in my right collarbone area and neck. it is uncomfortable all the time but when i cough it actually hurts, also when i lift my armshoulder as well. any suggestions on next steps with my doctortor???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      you are suffering from allergy and smoking is making it worse. you seem to be suffering from copd as well. your description suggests that you may have had a bout of chest infection which is not completely cured and hence you have developed symptoms again. you need to undergo some tests like a basic blood count and a chest x-ray to start with. it will help in ruling out pneumonia or any other pathology. consult a pulmonologist who can advise you correctly and also treat you properly.      copd as well  allergy, bone, pneumonia, blood, infection, ear, test, pain      copd as well\n",

      "2649  a few months ago, i noticed the middle finger on my left hand started getting stuck in the closed position when i would wake up in the morning. i also noticed there is a small bump at the inner base of that finger. after doing some research online, i found that this might be pointing toward arthritis (specifically trigger finger ). i am 33 years old, so this seemed odd to me, but i made a mental note and went about my business. plus, it started getting a little better as time went on. recently, i ve found that anytime i sleep on my left arm it starts to go numb and tingle (it falls asleep ). this has been going on for about a week, or so. and, for a couple of days within that timeframe, my left pinkie finger would tingle throughout the day. that sensation has gone away, but my arm still falls asleep when i lay on it. i am young (33), athletic (slendermuscular 230lbs, 6 5 ) and have always thought of myself as a generally healthy person, but this is starting to worry me a bit. i have thought this might be stress related, as i ve been working long hours at work, or that maybe i just need to get more sleep, as i am lacking in that area, as well. any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated. thank you!  hi, dear,welcome to chat doctortor. based on the facts and data of your query, you seem to have a complex problem from the disturbed forearm compartments, mostly due to the-overwieght issues with service spondylitis and due to the hypothyroid entrapment of the forearm nerves  or could be due to the? rheumatic nodule with synovitis, on the base of the left-hand middle finger  or could be due to the accompanied dupeutrans contracture, which may start like this or due to the psoriasis teno-synovitis of the left hand. all these possibilities would need to be ruled out by check up with and second opinion from your physician or with your orthopedic doctortor or sports doctortor, as you are an athlete. remedy-1-check out with ortho-surgeon and physician team if need be, would be needed to find out the cause of the stuck middle finger with nodule at the base of the left middle finger. only after proper x-ray and ct study of the indicated parts as advised from orthosurgeon, you could get the correct treatment either with the medicines and or with the surgical correction if need be.2-at 33 with 6ft 5 inches, you are still overweight, though muscular, and need to reduce on at least 20 kg to reduce the load on the hormonal system, which appears to be stressed with the stressed immune system, which seems to be causing this teno-synovitis or rheumatic problem in your upper arm and hand. hope this reply would help you to resolve your sever anxiety. welcome for any further query in this regard will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at chat doctortor. good day!! chat doctortor. s. genl-cvts     anxiety           arthritis, thyroid, nerve, ear, treatment           anxiety\n",

      "3163  hi doctortor,my daughter aged 3 is frequently having cough problem (twice or thrice a month).sh had an attack of nephrotic syndrome when she was 2 and since 7to 8 months she is off steriods and is ok.now our doctortor has prescribed inhalers for her frequent cough problem.is it safe for her??????  hi....inhalers are safe if given for appropriate indication and at appropriate dose and duration. suggestions1. there are certainly alternative management therapies in allopatry now-a-days. medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100 controllable.2. inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. if i were your pediatrician i would have suggested the use of decor metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. another metered dose inhaler is leveling and this can use as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of decor. the technique is very important and very crucial for the chat doctortor. regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. so do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. the technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctortor and these are prescription medicines. so i suggest you consult your pediatrician for this.3. triggers can be environmental changes dust talcum powder seasonal changes uncleaned a  c vent cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - the best person is the parent. hope my answer was helpful for you. i am happy to help any time. further clarifications and consultations on chat doctortor are welcome. if you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. wish your kid good health.    asthma    asthma, syndrome, therapy            asthma\n",

      "3676  hi. im very concerned about my boyfriend. evidently he had a root canal done poorly over a decade ago when he was young, and now its caused a cyst on the roof of his mouth. hes getting the root canal redone tomorrow as well as a biopsy, but the doctortor says that there is significant bone degradation in the area. im scared. could this be life-threatening?  thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the cyst is not life-threatening, but it has to be treated properly. get the root canal treatment done followed bye nucleation of the cyst. then send the biopsy to histopathological examination to rule out from other lesions like benign tumors. if there is severe bone loss we can try placing bone like material(graft) after nucleation of the cyst and support the tooth. if there is no possibility of placing the graft and if tooth is mobile then it has to be removed. consult a good oral maxillofacial surgeon and get it done hope my answer will help you, take care.  bone loss we can try placing bone like material  biopsy, treatment, tumor, bone  bone loss we can try placing bone like material\n",

      "4222  i started birth control (mid cycle, so not effective right away) recently and my package and doctortor said it will be effective without backup 7 days in. so, i took 7 pills consecutively and had unprotected sex the night after i had taken the 7th pill that morning. however, i realize this is technically six days, because the package says sunday to sunday whereas i did sunday to saturday, 7 pills but only 6 days. my partner did pull out as well, but i m still a little concerned. should i be worried about a pregnancy risk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                       hallow dear, you have to be worried. if you have started the pills midcycle, this cycle will not be protected. you will start getting the protection against pregnancy only from your next cycle, when your pills will be continuous from day 2 of the cycle. now, if you take two pills after the unprotected intercourse within 72 hours, you will get the same protection as post-coital emergency pill. beta chat doctortor test 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse will give you the reliable information of your pregnancy status. i would advise you to report to your gynecologist asap for further advice and any intervention if needed.   unspecified, pills       birth, ear, pregnancy, test   unspecified, pills\n",

      "4726  concerns for my daughter my daughter is two months old she was born after two days of being in labour and them breaking my waters n bringing my labour on by a drip then using the suction cup to pull her out after being dilated for two days when she was born i noticed she would shake her leg like a quiver but never thought much of it as i thought it might be her going to the toilet until a week later it mooved from that leg to her arm and mouth on the same side eventually it came to a point where her hole body would shake at time where i felt her spine shake and she would spew or have white frothy bubbles at her mouth i took her to see a peadiatrician who simply said it was a banine thing and she would grow out of it and it slowly stopped for a while but as of a week ago her legs and mouth have started to shake again but its not just that i have noticed she cant moove both legs at the same time she can only get one to moove with the other stopping half way the same thing with her arms she is also very stiff constantly and if her hands are open or closed when she goes stiff it takes her a while to close or open them again i have also noticed that her toes curl up and she cant uncurl them and has alot of trouble sleeping as in having to be held and as soon as you put her down she wakes up i took her to the doctortor again and two doctortors suggested i take her back to the peadiatrician as he was spose to do an ecg and blood test and she needs one done i want another opionion as to what another doctortor may think this all could be thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        hi.... by what you quote i feel your baby is having seizures. the history which you have provided regarding your pregnancy and associated complications during childbirth are also suggestive of the same. your baby will require evaluation for seizures in the form of eeg, and she might also require neuroimaging like ultrasound cranium or an mri brain. apart from this she will require metabolic work up like serum calcium magnesium and other electrolytes level in the blood. regards -                    seizures  birth, mri, ultrasound, blood test, blood, spine, brain, pregnancy, test                    seizures\n",

(you said your period is due in 2 weeks  if you have not taken any pill this cycle, today might be your ovulation day). if the guy had entered penis without condom, sperm rich pre-ejaculate might have entered vagina  there is possibility of pregnancy. hope this helps you. regards.  entered his tip briefly                                                    birth, vagina, sperm, ovulation, pregnant, pregnancy  entered his tip briefly\n",

      "5725  hi. i am female of 25 years old. i have been married past 1 and half years. we were in planning stage. but since from two months we are trying for a baby. last month we tried intercourse regularly that is i between 10 th day to 20th day. as we were knowing that ovulation occurs in between 12 to 16th day. during intercourse all the semen completely ejected into vagina. after sometime means after a hour it starts spilling out. we were in a hope that this month we can get a positive results but it was in a vain. and also the peneteration was medium. let me know what is the reason of not getting conceive?  hello, and i hope i can help you today. in normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80 of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). it is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately doctorumented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctortors office. the best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. there are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. so in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. i encourage you and your husband to have patience. in the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,                   nausea                                   birth, vagina, sperm, ovulation, semen, pregnant, ear, pregnancy, egg                   nausea\n",

      "6994  my dad is 90 years old. he is currently taking shots to correct his prostrate problems through his neurologist. he has a horse shoe kidney. i stopped his glipizide weeks ago because it would lower his sugar level to the 40s in the morning and now he has 98 readings in the morning. however, his blood pressure was always floating high to normal. recently, too high 200 over 98. he is taking two medicines for hbp. what could be causing pressure increases?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   hello, welcome and thanks for your query. your decision to stop glipizide was correct. the blood pressure is high and fluctuant due to multiple factors. his kidney function would be on the decline due to age, diabetes and a neuropathic bladder. this elevates blood pressure. another factor is the rigidity of arteries which gives a high pulse pressure. sometimes people require up to 4 medicines to control blood pressure. if you like i can review his medicines and give my opinion.                                                                                                   diabetes  blood, ear, bladder, kidney, diabetes                                                                                                   diabetes\n",

      "7993  a couple weeks ago i got severe abdominal pain that felt like a contraction that never went away for 3 days straight and during those three days i felt pressure on my stomach whenever i had to use the washroom, i urinated frequently, i had and still have back pains and sharp pains in my stomach and all over my body, i was and still am very weak i cant even open my sons bottles and now every time i stand up i feel like im going to faint, i am moody and i yell at everyone and cry at everything , i went to the clinic and they found blood in my urine but i wasnt pregnant or didnt have an infection, as of yesterday i have had a pain in my neck and shoulder i cant even move my head a certian way and today it is still killing me , i am also still feeling faint every time i get up and i also missed a period but then got it for 3 days a month later what do you think all of this could be?                                       hi. thanks for your query. the history of pain in abdomen with pressure on stomach on using washroom, frequency of urination, back pains, sharp pains in the abdomen and body pains is suggestive of a severe urinary tract infection along with possible secondary changes. urine is showing blood in the urine indicating the severity of the infection and chance of severe cystitis or pyelonephritis. the fainting and weakness are secondary to the infection. i would advise you the followingfirst send the sample of urine for culture and sensitivity before the antibiotic is started to get an appropriate result. get all the relevant tests of blood for wbc, urea, creatinine, sugar and so on. ultrasonography is the single most important investigations to tell us the changes in the urinary tract so that further treatment can be planned. intravenous paleography may be needed as is the cystourethroscopy. get started with proper antibiotic for 3 weeks  till get alright. urinary alkalizer with water thrice daily. increase the intake of oral fluids till you can tolerate., further treatment as per the findings on clinical and lab evidence. if surgical cause is found, get operated.  infection                       blood, pregnant, infection, stomach, treatment, test, pain         infection\n",

      "11106  my daughter who is 8 years old with down syndrome has dealt with constipation for nearly 5 years. we used apple juice and suppositories for awhile and the last 2 years she has had bladder infection symptoms. took her to urologist and he recommended putting her on miralax. started miralax and it got her going at least 3 times a week rather than once. she started vomitingdiarrhea so we thought she had flu bug. i stopped miralax. it continued off and on for next 2 weeks. went to pediatrician. they thought it was not viral and sent us to gastrologist. he did xray and she was not constipated and did blood work to rule out celiac. few days later she was vomiting and diarrhea again. still not taking miralax. got blood work back yesterday and no celiac. told us to give her a colon cleanse with miralax and chocolate exlax. woke up this morning and it did produce a bm and she s vomiting. should it cause her to vomit? is this ibs? could the miralax be causing the vomitingdiarrhea?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       hello, it would be helpful having at least a fecal analysis if this has been going on and off. its warranted to rule out a parasitic cause which needs antiparasitic medication. a stool culture could also be helpful to rule out any bacterial infection that is not identified with usual routine labs. this should help your son. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.      infection                                  colon, medication, blood, infection, ear, bladder, xray, syndrome         infection\n",

       "1   hi, i have been sick for about 4 years now. have had this intermittent illness, with severe body aches deep inner pain like someone beat me inside with a baseball bat at times, with even this chronic sore throat on one side of my throat....and feels like i have a low grade fever with it too. it is aweful! been going on intermittently for years now, and when i take american ginseng it goes away? when i stop taking it it returns and feels even worse. i have thyroid but have my blood tested every 6 months, just did a few days again again and my doctortor says my thyroid levels are normal and i am not anemic. my dad had pernicious anemia so i told my doctor and he said the blood work he did on my blood had no warning signs for that either. i used to work in maine as a gardener for over 10 years and worry maybe lyme disease or some other more serious auto immune disease? i also had a bad hiatal hernia but this started to happen to me way before the hernia got worse or i had symptoms with the hernia, so i don t think it is the hernia. i worry it is something far more serious and i can not get into see a new doctortor for 2 months as i live in a rural area and it is not good. i went for a 6 month stretch where i felt better, no symptoms at all, but i also left the town i live in and went to florida for a while and i notice that when i get out of the town i live in, i feel better too?? not sure if the air is bad here or the water?? i am at my wits end and have no clue what i may have or how serious?? please help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  your history suggests (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms.(2) you need to go for thorough workup like throat culture and sensitivity test, allergy panel test, other test which may be required after your physical exam.(3) best option is when you get complaints next time, you go to a good medical facility and consult internal medicine physician about your off and on complaints. internal physician would do physical examination and suggest further course most likely as i mentioned by me in 1  2  (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms                      thyroid, fever, ear, illness, anemia, pain, blood test, allergy, throat, blood, disease, test                anatomy, conditions, procedures\n",

       "1   hi, i have been sick for about 4 years now. have had this intermittent illness, with severe body aches deep inner pain like someone beat me inside with a baseball bat at times, with even this chronic sore throat on one side of my throat....and feels like i have a low grade fever with it too. it is aweful! been going on intermittently for years now, and when i take american ginseng it goes away? when i stop taking it it returns and feels even worse. i have thyroid but have my blood tested every 6 months, just did a few days again again and my doctortor says my thyroid levels are normal and i am not anemic. my dad had pernicious anemia so i told my doctor and he said the blood work he did on my blood had no warning signs for that either. i used to work in maine as a gardener for over 10 years and worry maybe lyme disease or some other more serious auto immune disease? i also had a bad hiatal hernia but this started to happen to me way before the hernia got worse or i had symptoms with the hernia, so i don t think it is the hernia. i worry it is something far more serious and i can not get into see a new doctortor for 2 months as i live in a rural area and it is not good. i went for a 6 month stretch where i felt better, no symptoms at all, but i also left the town i live in and went to florida for a while and i notice that when i get out of the town i live in, i feel better too?? not sure if the air is bad here or the water?? i am at my wits end and have no clue what i may have or how serious?? please help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  your history suggests (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms.(2) you need to go for thorough workup like throat culture and sensitivity test, allergy panel test, other test which may be required after your physical exam.(3) best option is when you get complaints next time, you go to a good medical facility and consult internal medicine physician about your off and on complaints. internal physician would do physical examination and suggest further course most likely as i mentioned by me in 1  2  (1) you may be allergic to some garden related - pollen  flower or any other allergen which can cause such off and on symptoms                      thyroid, fever, ear, illness, anemia, pain, blood test, allergy, throat, blood, disease, test                anatomy, conditions, procedures               fever         conditions\n",
