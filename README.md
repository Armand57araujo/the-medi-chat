# The-Medi-Chat


### Checklist for group project

### Completed

1. Finding the Data
2. Cleaning our Data
3. Building a prelim model to analyze the data (Armand's two methods of getting prognosis)

### WIP
1. Misha is building the model and training/testing it
2. I need to fully flesh out the functions from Misha's work into the Gradio App

### Below is stuff we can put inside our final readme

# Predicting your prognosis based on the symptoms given: THE MediBot
