Also I have bern experiencing stomach pains that prevent me from eating. I immediatly feel full and have extreme pain. Please help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   HI. You have two different problems. The lump under the nipple should be removed, biopsied. This will help you to get rid of the disease, and you get a diagnosis. Second problem looks a bit serious one: Pain that prevents you from eating-immediate fullness, and extreme pain. I would advise such a patient to undergo the upper GI endoscopy asap. This can be an ulcer with a problem at the pylorus. The exact diagnosis is the most important to start the right therapy. Do not waste time in starting the therapy.\n",

I have a 5 month old baby who is very congested with a terrible cough. Its rattly/raspy and croupy sounding cough. She started choking on her coughs and the mucous that has come up. She also has a fever and runny nose.

Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I would suggest that you see your doctor. Your baby maybe having bronchiolitis which is a lung infection common to your kids age. It is commonly caused by a virus. Albuterol via nebulization should be utilized in order to alleviate the wheezing and also help with the congestion. A decongestant can also be used for the colds. Also, it would also advise doing a chest X-ray in order to rule out other diseases (ex. pneumonia)sincerely, Mark RosarioGeneral pediatrics/Pediatric Pulmonology"
